Hi there !

App is written in Russian, those who don't understand it sorry... but you can use google translate or modify app to translate it.

I'm considering you are looking for notes (elemantry diary, you can use it like this) app or project, so you found it !

The project uses EEL library for UI and the core written in pure JS, it's also works localy (it's use LocalStorage).

If you don't installed this library before, you can just unarchive the venv folder, it contains virtual environment for python and also libary, that i mentioned before.

It's also has a executable (.exe) version, if you want you can use it, but it's works slowly(because of auto-py-to-exe library), but hey it's usable !

Some links and comands:
https://www.python.org/downloads/ - download python

venv\Scripts\activate - open cmd and put this comand, ones you unarchive venv.zip (you should unarchive it where it's stays, don't move it somewhere)
python notes.py - to start the project (put it after putting venv\Scripts\activate), once you done you tasks, put deactivate on cmd to deactivate venv
